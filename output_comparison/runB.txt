Here are some suggestions to improve the accessibility of your PDF.

1. **Add a Document Language:** Your PDF doesn’t clearly specify the language it’s written in (like English, Spanish, or French). This is important for screen readers to pronounce words correctly. In Acrobat, you can go to File > Properties > Language and set the appropriate language.

2. **Create a Proper Document Structure (Tags):** The PDF is missing a key element that tells screen readers how the document is organized – think of it like headings and paragraphs in a word processor. Acrobat has an “Accessibility Check” tool (Tools > Accessibility > Check Accessibility) that can help you identify missing tags and guide you through adding them. Focus on adding tags to headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.

3. **Mark Content as Artifact or Real Content:** The PDF checker found a lot of content that isn’t clearly identified as either meaningful text/images (real content) or purely decorative elements (artifact content). Screen readers will attempt to read *everything* in the document, so marking decorative elements as “artifact” tells the screen reader to skip them. Again, Acrobat’s Accessibility Check tool can help you find these areas and assign the correct classifications.

Addressing these three areas will likely resolve the majority of the accessibility issues. There may be other, smaller improvements needed, but these are the most impactful to start with.
